This repository hosts my vimrc. Feel free to fork it or make suggestions.

I'll keep updating it as I see new cool things to add.

###plugins:
  The headerGuard.vim script generates a header guard based on the filename.

###Color scheme:
  If you do not wish to use it, feel free to comment out the line:
    ``colorscheme solarized``

###Important Keyboard remappings
* The map leader is ``,``
* Both ``kj`` and ``jk`` are remapped to ``<Esc>`` This allows you to mash those 2 keys
* ``;`` is remapped to ``:`` (and ``::`` is remapped to ``;``)
* You can save and compile in one step by pressing ``<F9>``
* Insert a new line below the current line in normal mode by pressing enter
* Various shortcuts (using the mapleader) for copying to and from the X clipboard
* Remapping ``s`` to ``ctrl-W`` to making navigating splits a lot easier
* Other remappings that you can find in the vimrc

###Other useful things
* Columns over 80 characters are highlighted
* Tabs are remapped to 2 spaces
* Search is incremental
