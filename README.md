This repository hosts my vimrc. Feel free to fork it or make suggestions.

I'll keep updating it as I see new cool things to add.

###plugins:
  The headerGuard.vim script generates a header guard based on the filename.

###Color scheme:
  If you do not wish to use it, feel free to comment out the line:
    ``colorscheme solarized``
